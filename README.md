# ICT-Chrome-Extension
ICT Color Mod for Chrome


First Iteration: Change colors of the scheduler. Set any flag you want for colors in the extension options.

Second Iteration: Added QOL features to the extension to improve the ability of staff's club and schedule management.

# Features: 
* Color coordinated programs and classes, easily breaks up the scheduler two color scheme into digestible chunks.
* Toggle edit button from single click edit button
* Quick Roster button. Open the program roster with a button instead of using the drop down menu
* Check-In automatically marks users as attended when they scan in. Allowing them to bypass the desk and use a self check in station. Created for covid management
* Open user programs directly from their profile
* Labels next to a users name in the group class attendance roster. Helpful for staff to quickly see if a player is eligable for that class. 
* Download all junior rosters for the entire day, helps avoid going into each roster individually
* Tool to help remove expired members as this software does not have any batch/bulk operations at all.
